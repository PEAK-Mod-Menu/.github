## 💻 What Is the PEAK Mod Menu?

The **PEAK Mod Menu** is a slick GUI plugin (yep, we're talking ImGui here) that plugs into the game through **BepInEx**. It runs directly in-game with a smooth overlay and is activated with the **Insert** key.

This isn’t just a cheat — it’s a full-on command center for PEAK. You get movement hacks, teleport, revives, buffs, lobby control, and even inventory editing. It’s like admin mode in your favorite climbing sim. 🔧🎮
